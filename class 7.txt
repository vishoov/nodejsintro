SERVER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES 


server side -> data 
//allocation, management, fetch
//data is very very sensitive 


Layered

1.Password Security -> email, password -> the password is only known by the user , ENCRYPTION 
2. User Authentication  -> login one time -> features you can use these without repeatedly entering your email and password 
//movie -> tickets/token -> entry 
token based authentication 
signup or login -> email password -> token -> encrypted and verified string 
3. Server Security -> any unknown client side cannot access my server 
4. Rate Limiting -> restrict that how many requests a specific client can send 
//hackers -> DDoS -> server overwhelm -> 100000 bots request 
5. Environment Variables -> secret keys, uri-> hide from other developers 


password encryption -> bcrypt
user authentication -> jsonwebtoken
server security -> CORs cross origin resource sharing 
rate limiting-> express-rate-limiting
env variable-> dotenv
