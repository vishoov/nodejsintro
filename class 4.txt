Aspect          	SQL (Relational)	                        NoSQL (Non-relational)
Data Structure  	Tables with rows and columns	            Document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based
Schema	            Fixed schema (predefined structure)	        Flexible schema (dynamic and adaptable)
Scalability	        Vertically scalable (upgrading hardware)	Horizontally scalable (adding more servers)
Data Integrity  	ACID-compliant (strong consistency)     	BASE-compliant (more available, less consistent)
Query Language	    SQL (Structured Query Language)	            Varies (e.g., MongoDB uses its own query language)
Performance	        Efficient for complex queries 
                    and transactions	                        Better for large-scale data and fast read/write operations
Use Case	        Best for transactional systems          	Ideal for big data, real-time web apps, and data lakes
                  (banking, ERP, etc.)
